This game is meant for the DCPU, and is written in DCPU assembly. I suggest you use DCPU-16 Studio (http://badsector.github.com/dcpustud/) to run it - that's the emulator I use for development, and I/O has not yet been standardized. Hence, this game may not work on other emulators.

Currently, this game is primarily aimed at developers. You can't do a whole lot, and there's a lot of debug code still in it. Once I get it built out enough to have a downward staircase, I'll probably provide a bit more info for non-devs.

At present, you CAN combine this with other programs - type "Q" (shift-Q) to quit, assuming a DCPUStud-like interface. It should leave ALL registers the same as it found them, although that might change as things develop.

Devs: see the specs/ folder, for specifications about the game.
